## about

this project is being developed with a **motive to help save the Marathi language.**

The idea is to have a static website (ad free and bloat free) where people, 
looking to improve their Marathi voabulary, can search for an English 
word/phrase and quickly find its Marathi equivalent, and also usage example 
wherever possible.

Words can also be categorised into various topics (tags) so that words used in
same context can be found together. More features can be added in the future.
So basically it will be an ad free fast English-to-Marathi dictionary with
some additonal features.

## Development and contribution
It is currently in its very initial stage where I am conceptualising it and
looking for contributors (developers as well as people well versed in the
Marathi language).

I have in mind quite a few other ideas related to creating resources in Marathi
language, which I plan to start once I have this project's website first ready
at some usable level.

## what is there to save in the marathi language?

As I see it, there 2 main problems which are explained below -

1. **Excessive use of English words in Marathi sentences.** Simply stated this 
is using a lot of English words in our sentences where we could easily use 
Marathi words.
Example - saying "फार bore झालंय. चला एखादा picture बघू. " istead of saying - "फार कंटाळा
आलाय. चला एखादा चित्रपट बघूया. "
 The direct consequence of this is that we are loosing our grip on the Marathi
vocabulary. And this problem is ever growing like a snowball, which needs
external force and motivation. This problem exists in both the spoken as well as
 the written form. Also while this is particularly serious in the urban 
population, it may also expand to rural areas as the reach of English schools
and the internet widens.
*This project currently is for working on this problem only.*

2. **Typing/writing Marathi using the Latin alphabet.** 
 This is basically typing Marathi like this *"me tujhya sobat marathi bolat 
ahe."* instead of *"मी तुझ्या सोबत मराठीत बोलत आहे."*.  This problem is something 
that I feel should not exist in today's date, as we now have good keyboards for 
typing in Marathi using Devanagari on all platforms be it mobile or computers. 
However it continues to exist.
