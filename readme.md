# मराठी शब्द (Marathi shabd)

## About

This project is being developed with a **motive to help save the Marathi 
language** from its gradual and unnoticeable decline into a dying language.

The idea is to have a static website (ad free, bloat free and fast) where 
people, looking to improve their Marathi vocabulary, can search for an English 
word/phrase and quickly find its Marathi equivalent, and also usage example 
wherever possible.

Words can also be categorised into various topics (tags) so that words used in
same context can be found together to improve the vocabulary those particular 
topics. More features can be added in the future, if necessary.

So basically it will be an **ad-free and fast English-to-Marathi thesaurus for 
day-to-day words** with some additonal features.

## Development and contribution
It is currently in its very initial stage where I am conceptualising it and
looking for contributors (developers as well as people well versed in the
Marathi language).

Some places to do contributions

- **Database update** - adding English words with Marathi equivalents
- **Static website creation** - Basically parsing the database and creating an 
output markdown file with all the content. This file will be used on the 
github.io static website page. 
- **Adding content in Marathi language** to this project's documentation 
(readme, website pages etc.)

*(This is the current plan and can be improvised.)*


I also have in mind quite a few other ideas related to creating resources in 
Marathi language, which I plan to start once I have this project's website first
 ready at some usable level.

## What is there to save in the Marathi language?

As I see it, there 2 main problems which are explained below -

1. **Excessive use of English words in Marathi sentences.**

	Simply stated this 
is using a lot of English words in our sentences where we could easily use 
Marathi words. Example - 
  - Not OK - **"फार bore झालंय. चला एखादा picture बघूया."** 
  - OK - **"फार कंटाळा आलाय. चला एखादा चित्रपट बघूया. "**

 The direct consequence of this is that we are loosing our grip on the Marathi
vocabulary. And this problem is ever growing like a snowball, which needs
external force and motivation. This problem exists in both the spoken as well as
 the written form. Also while this is particularly serious in the urban 
population, it may also expand to rural areas as the reach of English schools
and the internet widens. 

	*This project currently is for working on the above problem only.*

2. **Typing/writing Marathi using the Latin alphabet instead of Devanagari.** 

 This is basically typing Marathi like this 
   - Not OK - **"me tujhya sobat marathi bolat ahe."**
   - OK - **"मी तुझ्या सोबत मराठीत बोलत आहे."**
   
    This problem is something 
that I feel should not exist in today's date, as we now have good keyboards for 
typing in Marathi using Devanagari on all platforms be it mobile or computers. 
However it continues to exist, as people find it easier to type using Latin 
alphabet on the qwerty keyboard.
