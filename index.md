## about

This is a simple tool to help you find a Marathi word for an English word.

## our motivation

When speaking or writing in Marathi we often, unknowingly and unnecessarily
 use a lot of English words.
Though this is a natural way for a language to evolve (by using loanwords), in
this case it is detrimental to the Marathi language.
Reason being - *(add 3-4 most impactful reasons here)*

- the loanwords are not adding to any missing gaps in the
Marathi vocabulary, but instead replacing existing words.
- many of the words being replaced are in fact far more efficient and easy to
  pronounce instead of their English counterparts. example -
  - चर्चा vs discussion
  - add couple of more examples here
- with every next generation of Maharashtrians, the knowledge of Marathi
  vocabulary is reducing and it has reduced drastically in the past few decades.
- as the reach of English medium schools and the internet widens, this phenomena
  will continue to grow even to rural areas
